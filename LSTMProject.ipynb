From there he took only the businesses, particularly restaurants, from the set and managed to pull out only the 5 star reviews.  Both of them were in JSON format and he converted them to CSV which he managed to open and view using pandas. He removed the newlines and duplicated reviews which was part of his preprocessing.  \n",
